```c
// Description
``` 

A **very** humble attempt to describe how to write software in C while learning the language itself. By following [antirez](https://github.com/antirez) approach to C in his video lessons uploaded on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@antirez), I keep track of each topic in this repository.

All the notes are written in a single `markdown` file to be self contained and avoid consulting any external source, so each code snippet eventually shown in lessons will also be included. I embraced the `CLI` approach to software development and I want to write this e-book to describe how I'm learning the language using tools I usually use.

This challenge has the only goal to improve my ability to write technical documentation in English and to organize all code and notions I learn. No [LLM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) will be used to write or evaluate any paragraph as this would reduce the effectiveness of the learning process.

The whole document is written to be converted in [PDF](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format) using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) so any complex syntax will be avoided.

```c
// Contributing
``` 

I generally don't accept contribution for this project as it is a learning project for me—but if you want to build the document from scratch you would need `pandoc` and the LaTeX engine: `XeTeX`.

You can use `make` to run commands and generate `PDF` and `HTML` docs.
