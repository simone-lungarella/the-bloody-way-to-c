# The Bloody Way to C

This repository contains all my personal notes written following [antirez](https://github.com/antirez) approach to C in his video lessons uploaded on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@antirez).

All the notes are written in a single file and each chapter tracks each lesson and it's written to avoid consulting any external source so each code snippet eventually shown in lessons will also be included. 

- Every snippet included is not copy-pasted but it's written and tested by me.
- Every opinion or side note will be highlighted as an author note.
- The whole document is written to be converted in [PDF](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format) using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) so any complex syntax will be avoided.

> I've created this repository and I intend to track whatever I understand by following the course to improve my ability to write technical documentation in English and to organize all code and notions I learn.
