# Bloody C

This repository contains all my personal notes written following [antirez](https://github.com/antirez) approach to C in his video lessons uploaded on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@antirez).

All the notes are written in a single file and each chapter tracks each lesson and it's written to avoid consulting of any external source so each snippet will also be included in text. 


- Every snippet included is not copy-pasted but it's written and tested by me.
- Every opinion or side note will be highlighted as an author note.
- The whole document is written to be converted in [PDF](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format) using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) so any complex syntax will be avoided.

> I've created this repository and I intend to track whatever I understand by following the course. I'm documenting everything in English because the main reason I have is to improve my English level.
