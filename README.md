# ![Terminal block cursor](./resources/block_cursor_favicon.svg)  The Bloody Way to C

A **very** humble attempt to describe how to write software with C language while learning the language itself. By following [antirez](https://github.com/antirez) approach to C in his video lessons uploaded on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@antirez), I keep track of each topic in this repository.

All the notes are written in a single `markdown` file to be self contained and avoid consulting any external source so each code snippet eventually shown in lessons will also be included. I embraced the `CLI` approach to software development and I want to write this e-book to describe how I'm learning the language.

This challenge has the only goal to improve my ability to write technical documentation in English and to organize all code and notions I learn. No [LLM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) has been used to write or evaluate any paragraph.

The whole document is written to be converted in [PDF](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format) using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) so any complex syntax will be avoided.
