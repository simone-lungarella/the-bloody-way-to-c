<p>This book is a humble attempt to capture every piece of information
given by Salvatore Sanfilippo—aka <a
href="https://github.com/antirez">antirez</a>—in his C course presented
in Italian on YouTube.</p>
<p>Each chapter is written following each lesson and, if needed,
integrated with personal consideration. Each snippet is written and
tested by the author and may vary from what is stated in the
lessons.</p>

C language, as an idea of computation</h2>
<p>C was invented in <a
href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Laboratories">Bell Labs</a>
when <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson">Ken
Thompson</a> was working on Unix. Following the idea that a good
operating system should have had a high level compiled language. After
abandoning the first attempt on creating a compiler for <a
href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran"><code>Fortran</code></a>, a
smaller new language was created and named <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_(programming_language)"><code>B</code></a>.
<code>B</code> better fitted <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11">P2P11</a> but was not enough
to port Unix from Assembly. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)"><code>C</code></a>
was created with a set of feature that were missing in <code>B</code>
and was a much better fit for the Unix system.</p>
<p><code>C</code> was a better language mainly because its multiple
distinct types:</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>pointers;</li>
<li>integer;</li>
<li>floating point numbers: float;</li>
</ul>
<p>In that sense, <code>C</code> language can be visualized as
<code>B</code> with types where all types can also be imagined as
integers since pointers—in very simple terms—are integers and so are
structures. In fact, structures are a set of integers representing
offset of each field position in memory and values of the very same
fields. This simplicity can be considered the strength of the language
as it can be easily picked up by new developers, layered to build a
powerful abstraction and, with that, achieve imagine in simple terms
complex topics and algorithms.</p>
